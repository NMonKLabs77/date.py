# Love A.I Restaurant 

This is a Python program that simulates a conversation between a couple and a restaurant's AI assistant named Love A.I. The program first asks the couple's names and then displays a welcome message. It then shows the food, drink, and dessert menus and prompts the couple to make their choices. 

After the couple has made their choices, the program calculates the total expense and shows the remaining budget.
It then asks the user if he/she would like to pay the bill and based on the output of expense > budget, if expense is more than budget he would not be lucky in having another 
date with this person.
